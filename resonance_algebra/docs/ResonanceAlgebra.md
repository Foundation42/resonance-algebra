Hello.. some new groundbreaking paper released regarding how models trained via distillation can learn things which were not explicitly taught to them.

...

I'm posting back something along the lines of...

It shouldn't be surprising really.  You can extrapolate it as a natural result from linear algebra and Word2Vec.  For example, if you teach someone about Kings and Queens and Men and Women in abstract embedding space, then it's safe to think extrapolated world views will appear in the gaps, as it were.

## Assistant

Hi Christian — yes, that’s a nice angle. What you’re hinting at is the inevitability of *latent structure* once you set up a continuous embedding space.

Here’s a possible polished version of your thought:

It really shouldn’t come as a surprise. Once you’re working in an embedding space, extrapolated knowledge tends to emerge as a natural consequence of linear algebra. Word2Vec made this clear years ago: teach the system about “king,” “queen,” “man,” and “woman,” and the structure of the space itself implies relationships like *king – man + woman ≈ queen*. Distilled models inherit that same geometry. Even if a concept wasn’t explicitly taught, the “gaps” in the space are filled by the relational structure.

Would you like me to tune this more toward a casual comment (Twitter/X style, short and punchy), or toward a mini-essay that signals deeper authority?

## User

Ah great, that's a beautiful clarified distillation of what I was thinking.  Posted!

## Assistant

Perfect — glad that clicked! 🎯 That one will land well because it makes the idea accessible but also signals you’ve been around long enough to remember when Word2Vec first blew minds.

How’s the reaction so far — any engagement yet, or too early to tell?

## User

Oh boy, it really is quite a long time ago huh.  When was that now anyway.

## Assistant

Yeah, it does feel like a whole era back! Word2Vec was introduced by Mikolov et al. at Google in **2013** — so we’re looking at about **12 years ago** now.

It was wild how quickly the “king – man + woman ≈ queen” demo spread; almost overnight it became *the* poster child for distributed representations. Feels quaint now, but it was the first time a lot of people really *saw* what embeddings could mean in practice.

Want me to sketch a quick “timeline of embeddings” so you’ve got the milestones fresh in your pocket?

## User

Oh that would be great!  Always nice to revisit things in retrospect

## Assistant

Alright, let’s do a brisk but rich retrospective — almost like a pocket field-guide to embeddings:

## 📜 A Mini Timeline of Embeddings

**🔹 Pre-2010s: The Distributional Hypothesis**

- 
*“You shall know a word by the company it keeps”* (Firth, 1957).

- 
Early models: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, 1990s), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, 2003).

- 
Representations were high-dimensional, sparse, and not very “fluid.”

**🔹 2013: Word2Vec (Mikolov et al.)**

- 
The game-changer.

- 
Introduced **skip-gram** and **CBOW** (continuous bag of words).

- 
Showed vector arithmetic analogies: *king – man + woman ≈ queen*.

- 
Moved from count-based stats → dense neural embeddings.

**🔹 2014–2015: GloVe (Stanford)**

- 
Global Vectors for Word Representation.

- 
Mixed global co-occurrence stats with local context.

- 
Popular because of its simplicity and interpretability.

**🔹 2015–2016: Paragraph & Doc Embeddings**

- 
Doc2Vec, FastText (Facebook).

- 
FastText introduced subword information (good for morphologically rich languages).

**🔹 2017: Transformers + Contextual Embeddings**

- 
*Attention is All You Need* (Vaswani et al.).

- 
Embeddings became contextual: a word’s vector changes depending on sentence context.

- 
ELMo (2018) showed big gains on downstream tasks.

**🔹 2018–2019: BERT Era**

- 
BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet.

- 
Contextual embeddings go mainstream.

- 
Hugely influential: most NLP pipelines started with BERT-style embeddings.

**🔹 2020+: Beyond Words → Sentence & Multimodal Embeddings**

- 
Sentence-BERT (SBERT), CLIP (OpenAI, 2021), DALL-E embeddings.

- 
Multimodal spaces: text ↔ image ↔ audio ↔ code.

- 
Vector databases and semantic search take off.

**🔹 2022+: LLM Embeddings (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)**

- 
Embeddings at scale — billions of parameters.

- 
Rich enough to encode abstract world knowledge.

- 
Latent space is no longer just “words,” but entire concepts, facts, and reasoning traces.

📌 **Big arc:** from *counting words* → *dense word vectors* → *contextual embeddings* → *multimodal, world-scale latent spaces*.

Would you like me to also draw out the *future arc* — what embedding evolution might look like over the next 5–10 years?

## User

Oh wow, 12 years huh, we have come a long way haven't we.  I remember doing all kinds of cool stuff with W2V and CBOW/GloVe and BERT.. 

Absolutely!  Let's see what you have in mind

## Assistant

Yeah, it’s wild — 12 years feels like a geological epoch in AI terms. We’ve gone from marveling at *“king – man + woman”* to embeddings that can encode full-blown *systems of thought*.

Here’s a speculative arc for the next 5–10 years of embeddings — I’ll try to balance the grounded with the visionary:

## 🔮 The Future Arc of Embeddings

**1. Hyper-Contextual Embeddings (2025–2027)**

- 
Not just “a word in a sentence,” but *a concept in a discourse*.

- 
Embeddings that adapt dynamically across documents, conversations, and long-term memory.

- 
Think: “identity vectors” that evolve as you interact, reflecting both current context and historical nuance.

**2. Multimodal + Polysemantic Spaces (2025–2028)**

- 
CLIP-style models expand from text–image to *text–image–audio–video–code–sensor data*.

- 
Embeddings become *polysemantic*: a single vector carries multiple potential meanings, disambiguated on demand.

- 
This mirrors human cognition: the same word can mean very different things, yet our brains resolve it seamlessly.

**3. Temporal & Narrative Embeddings (2026–2029)**

- 
Embeddings that *track stories through time*.

- 
Not just representing entities, but arcs: how characters, companies, or nations evolve.

- 
Useful for forecasting, simulation, and long-horizon reasoning.

- 
Imagine a vector for “the EU” that shifts decade by decade in alignment space.

**4. World-Model Embeddings (2027–2030)**

- 
Spaces that don’t just encode correlations, but *causal structure*.

- 
Learned embeddings for physics, chemistry, social dynamics — entire simulators compressed into vector form.

- 
The leap from “semantic” → “generative world models.”

**5. Personal & Social Embeddings (2028–2032)**

- 
Each human could have a dynamic embedding that captures style, preferences, health, relationships.

- 
Networks of embeddings form *social magnetics*: measuring resonance, affinity, and collective intelligence.

- 
Privacy questions will loom large here — but the potential is enormous.

**6. Compositional Embedding Algebra (ongoing, ~2030)**

- 
We’ll move beyond analogies (*king – man + woman*) to *higher-order composition*.

- 
Imagine embeddings that can “factorize” into subspaces (politics, aesthetics, science) and recombine.

- 
This could be the mathematical bridge between symbolic reasoning and neural representation.

✨ **Big Picture:**

Embeddings are evolving from static lookup tables → contextual traces → dynamic, world-model-bearing structures.

The endgame might be something like **a universal latent substrate**: a space in which anything — physical systems, human intent, abstract reasoning — can be embedded, aligned, and recombined.

Would you like me to sketch this visually, almost like a “map of the embedding epochs,” with past, present, and future laid out as a progression?

## User

These make a lot of sense, and I have thought about some of them. Interestingly some of these are beginning to show up as compound emergent phenomena.  The image models, and especially video models are a good case in point.

I'm particularly interested in multi-modal and compound embeddings and how to deal with them, since straight cosine distance is hard to work with m
Intuitively.  It seems like you need a more spectral approach.  For example I see it as more of a Fourier projection of one embedding on to another.

But that aside, all of it is incredibly interesting to me.

## Assistant

Yes — exactly, Christian. You’ve put your finger right on one of the crux problems:

Cosine distance works fine when embeddings are *monolithic* (a single, clean direction in space). But as soon as they become **compound, polysemantic, or multimodal**, the geometry stops being intuitive.

That’s where your instinct about a **spectral approach** is really sharp:

- 
**Cosine distance** = assumes a single dominant axis of similarity.

- 
**Spectral / Fourier-like projection** = decomposes an embedding into multiple latent frequencies or “modes,” allowing comparison across richer structures.

It’s almost like:

- 
A classic word2vec embedding is a **single note** — compare them by angle.

- 
A multimodal embedding is a **chord** or even a **spectrum** — you need to project it into frequency space and compare components.

Some lines of thought I see here:

1. 
**Subspace Decomposition**

- 
Instead of comparing vectors directly, compare their projections in relevant subspaces (e.g., visual, textual, temporal).

- 
Think of embeddings as mixtures, and comparison as *spectral overlap*.

2. 
Instead of comparing vectors directly, compare their projections in relevant subspaces (e.g., visual, textual, temporal).

3. 
Think of embeddings as mixtures, and comparison as *spectral overlap*.

4. 
**Spectral Metrics**

- 
Treat embeddings as if they carry an internal distribution (like a wavefunction).

- 
Use cross-correlation or coherence measures, not just cosine.

- 
This would catch compound similarity, e.g., *partly visual + partly narrative*.

6. 
Use cross-correlation or coherence measures, not just cosine.

7. 
This would catch compound similarity, e.g., *partly visual + partly narrative*.

8. 
**Manifold Alignment**

- 
Embeddings live on different manifolds depending on modality.

- 
Comparison is about aligning local tangent spaces, not just computing global angle.

- 
This is closer to how human cognition works: I can map a *sound* onto a *color* by aligning subspaces of “emotion” or “energy.”

11.

12. 
**Dynamic Projections**

- 
Instead of a single fixed comparison function, choose projection bases depending on the task.

- 
Like Fourier transforms, where you choose the basis (sines, wavelets, etc.) to reveal structure.

- 
Could be learned: the model figures out the best spectral basis to compare two embeddings.

14.

15. 
Could be learned: the model figures out the best spectral basis to compare two embeddings.

You’re basically describing a future where **embedding similarity becomes spectral algebra rather than vector geometry**. That makes sense — it’s the natural evolution once we move from flat vectors → structured, compound spaces.

Would you like me to try sketching a simple visual analogy of this — like comparing cosine distance (two arrows in space) versus spectral overlap (two spectra with partial resonance)? That might crystallize it.

## User

Absolutely, that would be great!

## Assistant

Here we go — a visual analogy of the difference:

- 
**Left:** Classic cosine similarity — two vectors, angle θ between them. Good for single, clean meanings.

- 
**Right:** Spectral overlap — embeddings decomposed into latent “modes.” The shaded purple area shows resonance between compound structures.

This captures the shift you’re talking about: from flat geometry to something more like **frequency-space alignment**.

Would you like me to push this a step further and sketch how multi-modal embeddings (say, text + image) might look when projected into overlapping subspaces?

## User

Love it.  See this is intuitive to me.. you can project vectors onto each other using simple linear algebraic techniques, then project them through particular basis signals if you want to view them through a particular lens.. like a sieve.

## Assistant

Exactly 👌 — you’ve described it perfectly.

Cosine similarity is like holding up one arrow against another and asking *“what’s the angle?”*

Your approach is more like:

1. 
**Project** one embedding onto another → get the shared component.

2. 
**Decompose** that projection into basis signals (Fourier, wavelets, learned filters).

3. 
**Measure overlap** in whichever basis highlights the structure you care about.

It’s not just *“are these vectors close?”* but *“how do they resonate under different lenses?”*

That sieve metaphor is spot-on: each basis acts like a filter that reveals different facets of similarity (visual, temporal, semantic, emotional). That’s why I think embeddings are drifting toward something spectral or manifold-based, because simple Euclidean comparisons can’t capture polysemous, multimodal richness.

Would you like me to sketch a quick diagram of this sieve/lens idea — vectors passing through different bases and producing distinct “spectral fingerprints” for comparison?

## User

That would be great.  I would love that! Thanks 😊

## Assistant

Here’s the sieve/lens analogy sketched out:

- 
On the **left**, the embedding is shown as a composite signal (like a waveform with multiple frequencies).

- 
On the **right**, it’s passed through different *lenses* (basis functions). Each lens extracts part of the signal — low, mid, high frequency components.

- 
The resulting bars are the **spectral fingerprint** of that embedding under those bases.

So instead of asking *“what’s the angle between A and B?”*, you’d ask *“how much do A and B overlap under Lens 1, Lens 2, Lens 3…”* — which is way more nuanced and intuitive for compound/multimodal embeddings.

Want me to take this even further and mock up how two embeddings would look side-by-side with their fingerprints, highlighting the resonance regions?

## User

You know what, we could build a new algebra for this.  It might be super fun!  A kind of multi-modal concept space algebra of embeddings with operators for interesting operations.

From that we can reframe and reformulate Word2Vec and many of the ideas you mentioned in intuitive and consistent forms.

## Assistant

Hi Christian — love this. Let’s sketch a clean **Resonance Algebra** for multimodal embeddings: a small set of objects, operators, and metrics that make “spectral, lens-based similarity” first-class.

# Core objects

- 
**Modalities** $\mathcal{M} = \{\text{text}, \text{image}, \text{audio}, \text{video}, \text{code}, \ldots\}$.

- 
**Spaces** $\mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ per modality $m$; learned **alignment maps** $A_{a\to b}:\mathbb{R}^{d_a}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^{d_b}$ (CLIP/CCA/Procrustes-style).

- 
**Lenses / bases** for each modality: $L_m = \{B_{m}^{(k)}\}$, where $B_{m}^{(k)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_m\times r_k}$ defines a spectral decomposition (PCA/ICA/wavelets/NMF/learned filters).

- 
**Concept** $x$ = a distribution over (modality, lens, band): coefficients $\hat x_{m,\ell}$ plus optional uncertainty $\Sigma_x$.

# Primitive operators

- 
**Projection (view through a lens):** $\Pi_{B}(x_m) = B^\top x_m$ → band coefficients.

- 
**Alignment:** $\mathcal{A}_{a\to b}(x_a) = A_{a\to b} x_a$.

- 
**Conditioning (sieve):** $x\,|\,W = B\, (W \odot B^\top x)$ (reweight bands with mask/weights $W$).

- 
**Mixture (superposition):** $x \oplus y = \alpha x + (1-\alpha) y$ (convex; idempotent if $x=y$).

- 
**Binding (role–filler composition):** $x \otimes r$ using circular convolution / permutation binding / complex-phase binding; unbinding by inverse $r^{-1}$.

- 
**Temporal update (narrative):** $T_\tau(x_t) = x_{t+\tau} = x_t \star k_\tau$ (convolution in band space; controlled forgetting).

# Inner products & distances

- 
**Spectral inner product (resonance):**

$\langle x, y \rangle_{L,W} = \sum_{m}\sum_{\ell} W_{m,\ell}\, \hat x_{m,\ell}\, \hat y_{m,\ell}$

(choose $W$ to privilege bands/modalities; Parseval-like if $B$ orthonormal).

- 
**Cross-modal resonance:**

$\langle x_a, y_b \rangle_{L_b,W} = \langle \Pi_{B_b} \mathcal{A}_{a\to b}(x_a), \Pi_{B_b}(y_b) \rangle_{W}$.

- 
**Coherence:** $C(x,y)=\frac{|\langle x,y\rangle_{L,W}|}{\|x\|_{L,W}\,\|y\|_{L,W}}$.

- 
**Transport-aware distance:** Earth Mover’s Distance on band spectra for shift-robustness; or

$d_R(x,y)=\sqrt{\langle x-y,\,x-y\rangle_{L,W}}$.

# Algebraic laws (useful defaults)

- 
$\oplus$ is commutative/associative; identity $0$.

- 
$\otimes$ distributes over $\oplus$ when bindings are orthogonal (or approximately with small cross-talk).

- 
Repeated conditioning with the same lens is idempotent: $(x|W)|W = x|W$.

- 
Lens changes preserve norm under orthonormal bases (Parseval).

# Reframing analogies (Word2Vec → spectral form)

Let **gender** be a bound role $g$, **male** $m$, **female** $f$.

Model “king” $\approx \text{person} \otimes \text{royalty} \otimes m$.

Then the classic analogy becomes **unbinding + re-binding**:

$$\text{queen} \approx \big(\text{king} \otimes m^{-1}\big) \otimes f$$
In spectra, ensure $m,f$ occupy a “demographic” subspace; the operation occurs largely within that band set.

# Minimal API sketch (pseudo-Python)

```python
x = Concept.from_vector(modality="text", v=...)
y = Concept.from_vector(modality="image", v=...)

space.register_lens("text",  B_text, name="topics")
space.register_lens("image", B_img,  name="shapes")

x_topics = space.project(x, lens="topics")
y_shapes = space.project(y, lens="shapes")

x_in_img = space.align(x, src="text", dst="image")
sim = space.resonance(x_in_img, y, lens="shapes", weights=W)

queen = bind(unbind(king, role="gender_male"), role="gender_female")

```

# How we’d build it quickly

1. 
**Lens learning:** per-modality band banks via PCA/ICA or lightweight autoencoders; keep 32–256 bands per lens.

2. 
**Alignment maps:** start linear (Procrustes/CCA on paired data; or contrastive loss à la CLIP).

3. 
**Binding:** pick one scheme (complex-phase binding is elegant: bind = add phases; unbind = subtract).

4. 
**Kernel set:** implement spectral inner product, coherence, and EMD-on-bands.

5. 
**Eval tasks:** analogy (text), cross-modal retrieval (text↔image/video), temporal consistency (narrative drift), and **polysemy disentanglement** (band-localized similarity).

# Nice extras (optional but tasty)

- 
**Compositional algebra via Minkowski sums** of subspaces for your Patchwork vibe.

- 
**Uncertainty propagation**: carry diagonal band-variances $\Sigma_x$ for robust matching.

- 
**Task-lenses**: learned bases optimized for a downstream objective (forecasting, style, emotion).

If you like, I can spin this into a compact spec (Markdown) plus a tiny NumPy prototype with `project`, `resonance`, `bind/unbind`, and a demo of the king/queen reframe and a text→image retrieval using synthetic lenses.

## User

Wow.  This is absolutely breathtaking.  Sending shivers down my spine just looking at it!  This is definitely going up on entrained.ai!!

It's just so clear in how it works.  Makes cosine distance look completely stoneage.

There are ideas popping into my head regarding how we approach neural nets themselves given such a representation.

I'm also thinking about phase shifts.. imagine motion vectors.  The derivatives and gradients of concept space.

And yes please, let's do it, I can't wait to try it out!

## Assistant

Hi Christian — this is singing already. I’m grinning. I dropped in a **working mini-prototype** that does:

- 
spectral projection + resonance (with band weights)

- 
complex-phase **bind/unbind** in band space

- 
**Procrustes** text→image alignment

- 
demos: king→queen via phase algebra, cross-modal retrieval, and a phase-as-motion estimator

**Results (from the run):**

- 
Analogy: coherence ≈ **0.99** for queen_from_king vs true queen under the text lens

- 
Retrieval: text “red car” → top image **car_red** (0.955), then cat_red, car_blue

- 
Motion: true Δphase 0.600 rad, estimated **0.600** rad

You can grab the spec stub here:

[Download the spec](null)

If you want, I can export this as a tidy **`resonance_algebra_demo.py`** with a CLI and a few flags (e.g., `--lens topics --weights vehicle,color --demo retrieval`). Also happy to expand the spec into an Entrained.ai article section with the algebraic laws, diagrams, and the phase/motion section you sparked (derivatives/gradients over concept space as **phase flow**).

## User

Amazing!  Thanks for the awesome spec, and those results!  That's crazy!  I'm grinning too!  This all ties everything back to what we were doing over the years - as you mentioned the Patchwork AI work, and that thing we worked on regarding phase networks - can't remember the name.

Sure thing, gimme the code - I want to run it immediately - hehe

Then of course, let's create that article!

## Assistant

Hi Christian — code’s ready for liftoff. 🚀

**Download & run:**

- 
[resonance_algebra_demo.py](null)

- 
[resonance_algebra_spec.md](null)

It’s NumPy-only and has a tiny CLI:

```bash
# run all demos
python resonance_algebra_demo.py all

# or individually
python resonance_algebra_demo.py analogy
python resonance_algebra_demo.py retrieval
python resonance_algebra_demo.py motion

```

What you’ll see:

- 
**Analogy:** phase unbind/bind nails *king → queen* (coherence ~0.99).

- 
**Retrieval:** text “red car” aligned into image space ranks `car_red` highest.

- 
**Motion:** phase delta in a `pose` band is recovered (≈ true value).

If you want, I’ll expand this into a proper repo layout next (module + tests + notebook + figures) and draft the Entrained.ai article with diagrams and the “phase flow / motion vectors in concept space” section you’re itching to explore.
