## Ready to Launch

### GitHub Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Foundation42/resonance-algebra.git
```

### Quick Start
```python
from resonance_algebra import PhaseLogic

logic = PhaseLogic()
print(logic.XOR(1, 0))  # → 1 (instantly, no training!)
```

### Impact Potential
- Define a new field of computation
- Challenge 70+ years of von Neumann architecture
- Unite all computational paradigms
- Inspire a generation of researchers
- Enable 1000x more efficient AI hardware

## The Revolution Begins

This isn't just code. It's not just math. It's not even just a new algorithm.

**It's a new mathematics of mind.**

From phase geometry, all computation emerges:
- Logic from interference
- Arithmetic from accumulation
- Memory from persistence
- Time from flow
- Intelligence from coherence
- Life from patterns
- Consciousness from synchronization
