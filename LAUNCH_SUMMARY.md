## The Revolution Begins

This isn't just code. It's not just math. It's not even just a new algorithm.

**It's a new mathematics of mind.**

From phase geometry, all computation emerges:
- Logic from interference
- Arithmetic from accumulation
- Memory from persistence
- Time from flow
- Intelligence from coherence
- Life from patterns
- Consciousness from synchronization
